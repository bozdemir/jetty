# Jetty Performance Budget

> Jetty = **Jet**. Raw speed is the #1 priority, above features. The goal is to be
> **faster than the terminals on the market** (alacritty, kitty, foot, Konsole/VTE,
> wezterm). This file is the gate: a change that regresses a budgeted metric is a

## How to measure (reproducible)

```bash
# Hot-path numbers (headless, no window): GPU init, throughput, snapshot, render.
cargo run --release -p jetty-app --bin jetty-bench
```

Live metrics (startup-to-first-frame, input latency, idle CPU, RSS) are measured
on the running app — see "Live metrics" below.

Baseline machine: Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX (24 threads), 62 GiB RAM,
Intel Arc (Arrow Lake) iGPU via Vulkan (LowPower — the NVIDIA dGPU is avoided on
purpose), 1920×1200 @ 59.95 Hz. Compared against the terminals installed here:
Konsole 23.08.5, GNOME Terminal / VTE 0.76.

## The budget

| Metric | Market reference (fastest class) | Jetty **target** (gate) | Jetty **current** | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Frame render** (full screen, 199×57) | 60 Hz = 16.7 ms; 144 Hz = 6.9 ms/frame | ≤ **6.9 ms** (144 Hz-ready); hard ≤ 16.7 ms | **5.5 ms** (180 fps cap) | ✅ meets 144 Hz |
| **Idle CPU** | ~0 % (event-driven terminals) | **0 %** when nothing changes | ~0 % (damage-driven redraw) | ✅ |
| **Per-frame CPU** (snapshot, 11k cells) | n/a | ≤ **1 ms** | **0.047 ms** | ✅ 20× under |
| **Throughput** (parse+grid, colored VT) | alacritty class: very high; VTE/Konsole: lower | ≥ **150 MB/s**; stretch ≥ 300 | **154 MB/s** | ✅ meets (stretch open) |
| **Cold start** (process → first frame) | foot ~40–60 ms; alacritty ~100–300 ms | < **150 ms**; stretch < 80 ms | gpu_init **~78 ms** (Vulkan-only backend; font load + PTY overlap it) | ✅ **meets target, near stretch** |
| **Input latency** (keypress → glyph) | foot ≈ 1 frame; the latency leader | ≤ **1 frame** added (< 5 ms beyond display) | architecturally ready (≤1 ms waker), not yet measured live | ⏳ measure |
| **Idle RSS** | alacritty ~30–50 MB; foot lower | < **80 MB** | not yet measured live | ⏳ measure |
| **Binary size** | — | informational | 15 MB (release) | — |

## Where we lead vs. match vs. must improve

- **Lead (architecture already gives us the edge):**
  - *Idle CPU = 0* — `drain_pty()` reports whether anything changed; idle frames
    are never drawn. Many terminals still wake for cursor blink.
  - *Input latency* — the PTY reader wakes the event loop within ~1 ms of bytes
    arriving (no polling tick on the keystroke path), and the render pipeline is
    one snapshot + one draw. This is the foot-class design; we must keep it and
    then prove it with a live Typometer-style measurement.
  - *Per-frame CPU* — snapshot is 47 µs; render is GPU-bound.
- **Match:**
  - *Throughput / frame time* — we use alacritty_terminal's parser, so raw
    parse speed tracks alacritty; render at 5.5 ms/full-frame clears 144 Hz.
    Both already beat VTE-based Konsole/GNOME Terminal on this machine.
- **Fixed (was the one red metric):**
  - *Cold start* — gpu_init went **224 ms → ~78 ms** by restricting the wgpu
    instance to the **Vulkan backend** (the default probed every backend), the
    single biggest win. On top of that, the **FontSystem font-DB scan and the
    PTY fork now run on worker threads** that overlap the remaining device
    acquisition, and **F9 global-hotkey registration moved off the main thread**;
    `[profile.release] lto = "thin"` trims runtime. Cold start now meets the
    <150 ms target and approaches the <80 ms stretch.
  - *Remaining headroom:* a CPU-painted first frame before GPU warmup could
    shave perceived latency further, but it is no longer the bottleneck.

## Gates (CI-style rules)

1. `jetty-bench` render ≤ 6.9 ms/frame and snapshot ≤ 1 ms/frame on the baseline.
2. Throughput ≥ 150 MB/s.
3. Idle redraw stays damage-driven (no unconditional per-tick `request_redraw`).
4. Nothing added to the keystroke → PTY → render path that isn't strictly needed.
5. Cold start trends **down**, never up; target < 150 ms.

## Live metrics (to fill in)

- **Cold start**: time from `exec` to first presented frame (instrument a one-shot
  `eprintln!` with an env-gated timestamp at first `RedrawRequested`).
- **Input latency**: Typometer or a high-FPS capture of keypress → glyph.
- **Idle RSS**: `ps -o rss` after the prompt settles.
- **vs. market**: same `cat 50MB` / `time seq` workload through Jetty vs. Konsole
  vs. GNOME Terminal, wall-clock compared.
